# FSM Video Player

A fully responsive video player app which utilizes a finite state machine to manage its state.

> “Finite state machines are a great conceptual model for many concerns facing
> developers – from conditional UI, connectivity monitoring & management to
> initialization and more. State machines can simplify tangled paths of asynchronous
> code, they're easy to test, and they inherently lend themselves to helping you avoid
> unexpected edge-case-state pitfalls.” (http://machina-js.org/)
